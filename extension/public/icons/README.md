# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16px (toolbar icon)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48px (extension management page)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128px (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can use any image editor to create these icons. For a quick start:

1. Use an online tool like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
2. Create a simple icon with the math symbol π or ∑
3. Export in the required sizes
4. Save in this directory

## Placeholder Icons

If you don't have icons yet, the extension will still work but will show a default Chrome icon.

For development, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders.
